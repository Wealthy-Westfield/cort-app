# cort-app

### Goals of the Project

The idea of this project was to design a TypeScript React App that could data from a downstream GraphQL source and display that data for a user to interact with.

The user could then search on the home page for Github Repositories.

### How it works

In the command window cd to where the folder is located at, then:

cd my-app

yarn start

This will open the app in the web browser. The app home screen has a search bar that allows the user to search a github user's username, this will show information about that user, such as how many public repositories are under their account.

### Issues with the Project

The intent was then display a small list of these repositories next to or below. This is where my lack of knowledge and experience with React and GraphQL showed itself. I was unable to get this to work properly. I tried a few different ways to get it to work properly, the one left commented in works occassionally but only for the example.
